    Take on the role of 12-year old Jude, who’s desperate to grow up and certain that they’ll do a better job of it than the so-called “adults” in their life. In fact, our protagonist just found out their parents, Mika and Jamie, are getting a dreaded divorce and they are NOT inclined to take it lightly.
