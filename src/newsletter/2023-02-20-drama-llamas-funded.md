    After a whirlwind week of nerves, excitement, watching "the big number" go up, and explaining the concept crowdfunding to elder relatives, we've only gone and done it! Drama Llamas is funded and my very surreal and silly dream is going to become a reality. Stretch goals have been announced. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/buttonkin" target="_blank">Check out the campaign page for more details</a>!

    Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the campaign so far! If any of you are looking for more projects, here are a few fellow designers who are working on wonderful projects this zine month:
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud Curio are launching a campaign to fund <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cloudcurio/broken-and-sleeping-hearts" target="_blank">two incredibly charming and aesthetically pleasing system neutral adventures TOMORROW</a>.</li>
        <li>Fellow Manchester-based designers, Hive Mind, are funding <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coreycreates/why-brother" target="_blank">two games inspired by the bizarre beasts and characters from medieval manuscript illuminations</a>.</li>
        <li>Another Manchester designer, Freddie Watkins, has a smash hit on his hands with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiewatkins/the-bookmarked" target="_blank">the_bookmarked, a game in a post-post-apocalyptic where any book on your real life book shelf can become a mystical tome</a>.</li>
    </ul>
