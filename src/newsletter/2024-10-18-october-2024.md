    <strong>Oh hey! It’s been a minute. What’s new with you?</strong> Oh, me? Not much, just finished a Kickstarter campaign and then went off grid for a month to de-stress. Yeah, feeling much better thanks.
</p><p>
    I did promise myself that this newsletter would be the post-Kickstarter wrap up - what worked, what didn’t, what’s next - but it doesn’t feel like time for that yet. Maybe once the books are out in the post and the campaign is really and truly over? Yeah. Let’s do it then. In the meantime I have a couple of updates and the next chapter of my Development Diary. Let’s do this!
</p>
<h3>Little Wins</h3>

    <strong>Even more llamas!</strong> While I was away resting my brain post-Kickstarter I found time to write up and lay out a trio of one-shot session plans for <a href="https://buttonkin.itch.io/drama-llamas" target="_blank">Drama Llamas</a> and chuck them out into the world. Each plan includes a unique show concept, plus all the locations, NPCs, and challenges you need to run a high hilarity session of my reality TV themed TTRPG. They’re available on my <a href="http://buttonkin.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> for just £1 each. Or if you’re around in Manchester this Saturday I’ll be selling physical copies on my stall at <a href="https://dungeonsandflagons.co.uk/events-1/mcr-geek-fayre" target="_blank">Manchester Geek Fayre</a>. Come by, say hi!
</p><p>
    <strong>Aegean!</strong> I think mentioned a while back that I’d landed my first writing job for not-my-own-game? Let’s say I did. I’m too lazy to actually go back and check. Well, that was a chapter for a Peloponnese-themed source book for Aegean, a marvellous TTRPG of ancient Greek heroism and politicking from We Evolve Publishing. If you, like me, can’t get enough of ancient civilisations and mythology, check out <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stoo-goff/aegean-the-isle-of-pelops" target="_blank">Aegean: The Isle of Pelops</a>, coming soon to Kickstarter. You can also find the core rule books on <a href="https://www.aegeanrpg.com/" target="_blank">We Evolve’s website</a> now along with existing expansions, including campaigns set in ancient Crete or Troy.

<h3>Development Diary: Jude’s World, Part 11</h3>
<p>
    So, where is the game up to now? Well, the Kickstarter was a modest success, so we have the funding to finish the game and do a print run. The text has been edited and proof-read. It’s time for layout.
</p><p>
    I love this part of the process. Creating the visual theme to match a game’s content and atmosphere is my idea of play time. I also really like organising things and layout is very that: tetris-ing blocks of text together, filling gaps with the right image. So satisfying.
</p><p>
    I’m going for a very 90s Funfax, tabbed-notebook theme with bright colour pops but simple, legible rules text. I have a few previews which are more fun than me explain-ifying. Let’s take a look…

    Missed the campaign and still want a copy? No worries! Pre-orders for the game are now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/buttonkin/judes-world" target="_blank">live on Kickstarter</a>, and will be available until the end of this month. Go go go!
