    It’s a short newsletter with a very straightforward message this month, friends! After months and months (and MONTHS) of writing, playing, re-writing, editing, and endless chatter <a href="https://kickstarter.com/projects/buttonkin/drama-llamas" target="_blank">Drama Llamas is finally open to pledges on Kickstarter</a>. Like a fool I activated the campaign before my bed time and now I am a giddy, proud, sleep-deprived zombie. Sooo, giz a pledge so I can sleep? JK, pledge because you love llamas ❤️

    I’m pleased to say that the campaign is already <b>over 40% funded</b>, thanks in part to the ZineQuest 5 initiative, and Kickstarter’s kind decision to add Drama Llamas to their “Project We Love” tag. Check out the other creators doing amazing things under both of those umbrellas!

    In other news, if you’re looking for a good read my friend Rick, aka MostlyLions, has a new blog series of tabletop design and the value of embracing and learning from failures. You can read the first in the series <a href="https://www.thecloudcurio.com/post/how-to-design-a-game-by-rick-age-8" target="_blank">here</a>. I’m already hooked, myself!
