    <strong>Hello friends, here I am again. Newslettering while the world burns.</strong> Unfortunately I’m writing to you mere days after the worst man in the world got elected Most Powerful Man in the WorldTM AGAIN and have been holding so much rage in my body ever since that I woke up today feeling like I’d been hit by a lorry full of bigots.
</p><p>
    I’ve written, tweaked, and deleted so many very righteous rants that you don’t need to read. Short version: I have no neat answers and no fresh insights. While I’m not US-based myself, I’ll still be contributing what I can to environmental, trans rights, and reproductive rights actions here in the UK, showing ever more care for my immediate community, and continuing to make the stupid, weird art that feeds my soul. We must find the joy to sustain us somewhere. Joy is a necessity. It cannot and must not wait for perfect conditions.

    <strong>Jude’s World digital!</strong> Digital fulfillment of Jude’s World is complete for my fabulous Kickstarter backers. This means that the game is now available on itch.io for those of you who missed the campaign window. Here you go, slow pokes: <a href="https://buttonkin.itch.io/judes-world" target="_blank">https://buttonkin.itch.io/judes-world</a>

    <strong>Manchester Geek Fayre!</strong> I had such a lovely time stalling at this brand new event in my adoptive home town. Good to see friends and meet new people, and to talk about games to real faces instead of type about them. To myself. On a screen. Like I’m doing right now. Sorry, got a bit dizzy there. There’s another one coming up 14th/15th December. I won’t be there because I’ll hopefully be elbow deep (ew?) in Jude’s World Kickstarter fulfillment. But if you’re in the NW of the UK and you like games and gaming gifts and you’d be a fool to miss it: <a href="https://dungeonsandflagons.co.uk/events-1/mcr-geek-fayre" target="_blank">https://dungeonsandflagons.co.uk/events-1/mcr-geek-fayre</a>

<h3>Development Diary: Jude's World, Part 12</h3>
<p>
    With the digital distro all done and dusted it’s been full steam ahead on the printing. I’m ecstatic to say that I’ve been working with <a href="http://fistful.ink/" target="_blank">Fistful of Ink</a> on the zine version of the game and its companion workbook.

Two are Jude's World zines with a colourful cover depicting a young person with turquoise hair writing in their diary. One is shiny, the other is matte. In the middle and slightly obscured by the zines is a purple workbook with Jude's World companion workbook on the cover">

    We’ve been through a few test prints, trying to find the right recycled or otherwise eco-friendly paper stocks to meet the quality I’m looking for in terms of both colours and durability. I think we’re very close.
</p><p>
    Truly <a href="http://fistful.ink/" target="_blank">FoI</a> have been so very, very helpful throughout this process. Above and beyond expectations. This experience is so much different from working with a larger company like. Imagine getting your books made affordably, to a high standard, on eco-friendly paper, while also being talked like a… what-cha-ma-call-it… a person? Instead of an order number? It’s hot, frankly.
