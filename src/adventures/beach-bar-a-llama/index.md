This is a postcard-sized one-shot for Drama Llamas - a reality TV themed TTRPG about fame hungry llamas. To this play you'll need the <a href="/drama-llamas" target="_blank">rule book</a>, 3-5 players, and a GM, or “Producer” to facilitate the fun.
</p><p>
In Beach Bar-a-Llamas our cutthroat camelid contestants compete to build the hottest beach bar on a newly discovered island in the Medita-llam-ian. The winner gets to keep their business and run it for-real-for-real.
