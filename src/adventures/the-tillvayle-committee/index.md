What if the monsters got old enough to retire? Where would they go to rest their weary bones? The picturesque, rural village of Tillvayle might do.
</p><p>
But what's this? Tillvayle isn't so restful right now. The small farming community has been shocked by two gruesome murders in the last month. Beryl Clodston and the other members of The Tillvayle Committee for the Preservation of Tillvayle are working hard to restore the peace, but will a few sternly worded signposts on the common be enough?
</p><p>
The Tillvayle Committee is an OGL murder-mystery adventure for the world's most popular roleplaying game. Inspired by small British towns and NIMBYs the world over, it's a treat for fans of Midsomer Murders, Hot Fuzz, and any other media about grisly murders in a small town.
