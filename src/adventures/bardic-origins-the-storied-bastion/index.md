    Deep in the wilderness atop a 1000 foot high cliff stands an institution dedicated to the cultivation and preservation of the bardic arts: The Storied Bastion.
</p><p>
    Within the bastion's walls a cadre of elder scholars known as the Anthologists work to shepherd their fellow bards through the first and last chapters of their life stories. Part elite academy and part retirement village, scholars throughout the realm know the Storied Bastion as the site of the greatest archive of bard's tales ever compiled.

<h5>Shibelurn's Wrath</h5>
