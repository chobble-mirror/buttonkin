Take on the role of 12-year old Jude, who's desperate to grow up and certain that they'll do a better job of it than the so-called "adults" in their life. In fact, our protagonist just found out their parents, Mika and Jamie, are getting a dreaded divorce and they are NOT inclined to take it lightly.

A game, a love story, and a in a coming-of-age comedy-drama all in one, Jude's World pays homage to and critiques "Parent Trap"-style narratives as well as revelling in a 90s sitcom tone inspired by the likes of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Clarissa Explains it All.
