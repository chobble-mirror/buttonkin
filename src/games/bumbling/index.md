    Welcome to the hive, worker-bee! You just hatched and your head is as fuzzy as your body. Your siblings are beckoning for you to join them at heart of the hive - the dance floor! This world is new and strange, and you don’t know your own name yet, but you think you might know a bit about dancing...
</p>
<p>
    In this game you'll learn your hive’s secret dance language, explore and map your world, make animal friends, and harvest pollen for your hive. This is a sweet, relaxing game to play on a rainy afternoon while journaling and doodling.
