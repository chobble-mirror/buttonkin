    You're a budding psychic and have decided to take a night school class called “Introduction to the Spirit Realm with Mademoiselle Charlotte-Ann”. In this class you'll meet and get to know your fellow psychics, test your connection with the spirit realm, and create your own tarot cards before performing a reading for one of your classmates.
