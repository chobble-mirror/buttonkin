      text: "When I played Drama Llamas with my buddies I got the giggles so bad that I couldn't talk. It's really easy to play and leaves a lot of room for improvisation and silliness, although there's a clear structure to gee things along too. Some of the artwork is BEAU-TI-FUL! The instructions are funny and loaded with puns and ideas for games. Overall, it's a really charming and entertaining game presented in a very slick package. A++ would recommend!",

_Welcome fellow llamas, and congratulations! You have been chosen from vast throngs of eager applicants to compete in the hottest new reality TV contest on the block. You have big dreams, the camera loves you, and whether your eye is on the prize, on lasting fame, or both, this show could be your big break. You must seize this opportunity with both hooves!_

Drama Llamas is a narrative driven TTRPG about reality TV competitions. Easy to plan and easy to play, the game contains everything you need to create (or recreate) the reality franchise of your dreams. The game is packed with genre tropes and chaos-generating mechanics, all with an absurdist, llama-flavoured twist.
