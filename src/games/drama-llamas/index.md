      text: "This was such a bonkers-fun game! It's all about going full ridiculous and playing the shadow game behind the scenes. But the game itself encourages communication between the players so that it's reframed as collaboratively creating drama rather than a PVP type game.",

      text: "When I played Drama Llamas with my buddies I got the giggles so bad that I couldn't talk. It's really easy to play and leaves a lot of room for improvisation and silliness, although there's a clear structure to gee things along too. Some of the artwork is BEAU-TI-FUL! The instructions are funny and loaded with puns and ideas for games. Overall, it's a really charming and entertaining game presented in a very slick package. A++ would recommend!",

Drama Llamas is a narrative driven TTRPG about reality TV competitions. Easy to plan and easy to play, the game contains everything you need to create (or recreate) the reality franchise of your dreams. The game is packed with genre tropes and chaos-generating mechanics, all with an absurdist, llama-flavoured twist.
