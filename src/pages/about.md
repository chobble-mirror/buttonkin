Button Kin Games is a small independent TTRPG publisher based in Manchester, UK. It was established in 2020 as an imprint for works by Yvris Burke, covering her adventure content for more traditional systems as well as her stand alone roleplaying games.

Having run her first game just before the dawn of the pandemic era, Yvris (pronounced Eve-ris) suddenly found herself with a lot of time to immerse herself in different systems and roleplaying experiences, developing a borderline obsession. No more than 6 months later she decided to start making her own games. Friends of Yvris will recognise this charming combination of hubris and masochism as quite typical.

Drawing on a life long love of sci fi, fantasy, whimsy, and wry humour, Yvris is best known for her solo TTRPG about being a baby bumble bee, [_Bumbling_](/bumbling/), her reality TV TTRPG about sassy, cutthroat llamas [_Drama Llamas_](/drama-llamas/), and her [_work_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9JJWbzp1YI) [_streaming_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNjlJOIvbAI) with [_Girls Run These Worlds_](https://www.twitch.tv/girlsruntheseworlds).

In addition to the above Yvris is into Star Trek, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Ghibli, animals, art history, leftist politics, tattoos, witchy aesthetics, crafts, the art of drag, veganism, and noisy, angry, experimental music. If you want to talk about any or all of those things you can contact her at [yvris@buttonkin.com](mailto:yvris@buttonkin.com)
